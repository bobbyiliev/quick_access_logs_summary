## Pull Requests

### Creating a Pull Request

This application has been designed so that people can easily expand it.
To request us to review code that you create, you will need to create a pull request.
Creating a pull request is described in
 [this tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-pull-request-on-github).

## Continuous Integration

This repository uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration. Each pull request will automatically:
- Run shellcheck on all shell scripts
- Execute the test suite
- Verify code formatting

## Issue Creation

In the event that you have a issue using the tool or have a suggest for a change but don't want to contribute code,
 we are more than happy to help.
Make sure that when you create your issue, it follows the format for the type of issue you select
 (it has individual templates for each issue type).

Issue template types include the following:
 - Bug Reporting
 - Feature Requests
 - Help Requests
